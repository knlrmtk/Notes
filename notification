Email Notifications In Jenkins
################################
-> We can configure Email notifications in Jenkins
-> With this option we can send email notification to team members after jenkins job execution completed.
-> We need to configure SMTP properties to send emails

		-> Go To Manage Jenkins 
		-> Go To System
		-> Go to "Extended E-mail Notification"
		-> We will add company provided SMTP server details to send emails.

Note: For practise we can use GMAIL SMTP Properties

SMTP Server : smtp.gmail.com
SMTP Port : 587

Note: Under Advanced section add your gmail account credential for authentication purpose.
##### Note: Instead of gmail password we need to add gmail app password ######
##### URL To generate gmail app pwd : https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
=> Select use TLS checkbox
=> For testing purpose we can use "Email Notification option which is available at the bottom of the page"
